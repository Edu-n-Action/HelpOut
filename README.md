HelpOut is a comprehensive platform for community management. With features to assist tasks such as event management, fundrasing, community management, and more.

## About

Our project aims to solve the hassle of running volunteering communities through a web-application solution. Notable features include forming events, organizing donations/fundraising, managing daily tasks for individual volunteers, and more. It is hoped that our web application can accelerate the operations of volunteering communities everywhere, who are positively impacting the lives around them.

## Features

Our web-app allows volunteering communities to:

- Conduct/establish events with informations, peers selection for tasks, and upload materials (event flow)
- Setup fundraisings with a website page that displays QR to donate and counts online donations, both events and fundraisings goes straight into the schedule calendar (fundraisings flow).
- Store necessary materials in libraries for bookkeeping (libraries flow).

For volunteering members, the web app allows them to:

- Join a community
- Attend and do tasks as assigned by the community.
- Access to materials and information from the community.(one big flow)

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
  Next.js is used in order to build the front-end side of the web app. It is one of the most frequently used framework in the field of web-development. Additionally, it is one of the simplest ones to implement
- Firebase
  Firebase is used for the back end and the database. We store all users, communities, events, and donations data into it. Firebase is used because of simple implementation, robust built-in feature, secure server, and it is in the cloud
